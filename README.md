# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects aimed at exploring fundamental concepts and algorithms. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. The projects here focus on basic implementations of linear regression, a foundational technique in supervised learning. More projects will be added to this repository over time, building upon different machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Univariate Linear Regression Model Representation
   - A simple project demonstrating a linear regression model with one variable (univariate) to understand the relationship between input and output.
   - The project showcases the underlying mathematics and graphical representation of a line fit to data.

### 2. CO2 Emission Calculation with Linear Regression (Manual Algorithm)
   - A linear regression model created from scratch to predict CO2 emissions based on different input features.
   - This project does not use any pre-built libraries, giving insight into the mechanics of the algorithm.

### 3. CO2 Emission Calculation with Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)
   - Implements a linear regression model using the popular `scikit-learn` library for CO2 emission prediction.
   - This project highlights the efficiency and simplicity of using machine learning libraries to build predictive models.

## Future Additions
More machine learning projects will be added to this repository to cover a wider range of algorithms, datasets, and techniques.
